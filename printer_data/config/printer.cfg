max_temp: 100
control: pid
pid_Kp: 74.421
pid_ki: 1.494
pid_kd: 926.537
#   The proportional (pid_Kp), integral (pid_Ki), and derivative
#   (pid_Kd) settings for the PID feedback control system. Klipper
#   evaluates the PID settings with the following general formula:
#     fan_pwm = max_power - (Kp*e + Ki*integral(e) - Kd*derivative(e)) / 255
#   Where "e" is "target_temperature - measured_temperature" and
#   "fan_pwm" is the requested fan rate with 0.0 being full off and
#   1.0 being full on. The pid_Kp, pid_Ki, and pid_Kd parameters must
#   be provided when the PID control algorithm is enabled.
pid_deriv_time: 2.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed when using the PID control algorithm. This may reduce
#   the impact of measurement noise. The default is 2 seconds.
target_temp: 50.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that will be the target temperature.
#   The default is 40 degrees.
max_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when the sensor temperature exceeds the set value.
#   The default is 1.0.
min_speed: 0.3
#   The minimum fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that
#   the fan will be set to for PID temperature fans.
#   The default is 0.3.

[firmware_retraction]
retract_length: 0.4
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
retract_speed: 30
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
unretract_speed: 30
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

[gcode_arcs]
resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a
#   finer arc, but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than
#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.


[input_shaper]
shaper_freq_x: 36.7
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for X axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of X axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for X axis.
shaper_freq_y: 37
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for Y axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of Y axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for Y axis.
shaper_type: mzv
#   A type of the input shaper to use for both X and Y axes. Supported
#   shapers are zv, mzv, zvd, ei, 2hump_ei, and 3hump_ei. The default
#   is mzv input shaper.
#shaper_type_x:
#shaper_type_y:
#   If shaper_type is not set, these two parameters can be used to
#   configure different input shapers for X and Y axes. The same
#   values are supported as for shaper_type parameter.
damping_ratio_x: 0.1
damping_ratio_y: 0.1
#   Damping ratios of vibrations of X and Y axes used by input shapers
#   to improve vibration suppression. Default value is 0.1 which is a
#   good all-round value for most printers. In most circumstances this
#   parameter requires no tuning and should not be changed.
